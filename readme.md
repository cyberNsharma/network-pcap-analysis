# 🌐 Network PCAP Analysis  

A beginner-friendly **network traffic analysis** using Wireshark.  
This repository demonstrates how to extract insights, apply filters, and analyze captured packets — a core skill in **SOC (Security Operations Center)** and **digital forensics investigations**.  

---

## 📁 Files Included  
- `network.pcapng` – Original packet capture file.  
- `analysis/network_analysis_notes.md` – Q&A style solved notes with filters and findings.  
- `filters.txt` – Useful Wireshark filters applied during analysis.  

---

## 🔧 Tools Used  
- **Wireshark** – for packet inspection and filtering.  
- **Basic Linux commands** – for handling `.pcap` files (optional).  
- **Git & GitHub** – for version control and repo hosting.  

---

## 🧪 Analysis Performed  
- Identified protocols present in the capture (DNS, TCP, SMB, DHCP, etc.).  
- Solved step-by-step questions with filters and findings.  
- Traced IP conversations, handshakes, and service ports.  
- Analyzed application-layer data (e.g., DNS queries, SMB activity).  
- Flagged anomalies and suspicious patterns.  

---

## 🧠 Key Learnings  
- How to **apply Wireshark filters** for different protocols.  
- Understanding common **network protocols** and their behavior.  
- Performing **triage analysis** on a PCAP file.  
- Recognizing **indicators of compromise (IOCs)** in network captures.  

---

## 📌 Use Case  
This repository is useful for:  
- Students learning **networking & packet analysis**.  
- Beginners practicing **Wireshark & SOC workflows**.  
- **SOC Level 1 aspirants** preparing for triage tasks.  
- Anyone exploring **how network packets behave** in real traffic.
