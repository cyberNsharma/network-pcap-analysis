## üîß Analysis Tools & Filters Used  
**Wireshark Filters Applied:**  
- `dhcp` ‚Äì to isolate DHCP packets  
- `dns` ‚Äì to review DNS queries/responses  
- `stp` ‚Äì to capture Spanning Tree Protocol events  
- `cdp` ‚Äì to check Cisco Discovery Protocol announcements  
- `snmp` ‚Äì to locate SNMP queries and responses  
- `hsrp` ‚Äì to identify HSRP traffic and virtual IP  
- `ntp` ‚Äì to check NTP server communication  
- `ipv6` ‚Äì for IPv6-specific traffic inspection
